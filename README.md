# use-LLM-with-Python

This repo contains usages of many LLM tools, just try ipynbs in it or see [tutorial on notion](https://working-pikas.notion.site/72f875a4ad994edaa7b5dea5a1e4948b?v=9650821aca204009ba23f15eb2175129) (Updated from time to time)

BTW, It's highly recommended clicking the link toward Colab in any ipynb to read codes cuz UI of Github is uglier.
